        Instructions
        
        Making Coriander Chutney
        In a grinder or blender grind all the above chutney ingredients to a smooth paste using very little water. Set the chutney aside. If there are leftovers, then keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
        Preparing Veggies
        Boil or steam the potatoes and beets if using them. They should not be cooked too much or fall apart. Just cooked well until softened. Peel and slice them when warm.
        Rinse, peel and slice the onion, tomatoes and cucumber in thin rounds.
        Assembling Sandwich
        Butter all the bread slices. The butter has to be spread evenly and generously so that the bread does not become soggy on spreading the chutney. Spread some green chutney on the slices.
        Place a few slices of potatoes and then sprinkle with roasted cumin powder and chaat masala powder.
        Then place 2 to 3 cucumber, tomato, onion and beet slices if using them. Sprinkle roasted cumin powder, chaat masala powder or sandwich masala and black salt.
        Cover the sandwiches with the remaining slices of bread.
        Spread butter on the top of slices.
        Grilling Sandwich
        In a preheated grill, place the sandwich carefully with the buttered side facing at the bottom. Be careful when doing this. Now spread butter on the top side facing you.
        Close the grill and grill the sandwiches for 2 to 3 minutes or until crisp and golden.
        Remove the grilled sandwiches with a wooden spatula. In batches grill the next lot.
        Serve the grilled sandwich hot with tomato ketchup and coriander chutney or any other green chutney of your choice
